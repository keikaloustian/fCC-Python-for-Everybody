# DEFINING A BASIC FUNCTION
def greet():
    print('Hello there')

# Calling the function
greet()  # -> Hello there

# Python has built-in functions such as print(), int(), type(), float(), etc


# MAX & MIN BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS
max('Hello world')  # -> w (works on strings, in terms of lexicographic order)
min(1, 19, 44)  #  -> 1
