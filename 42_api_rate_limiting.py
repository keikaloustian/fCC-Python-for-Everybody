# RATE LIMITING & SECURITY
# APIs have costs and often supply valuable information so many providers will limit the rate users can make requests.
# It is also common for APIs to require accounts and authorization keys.
# Technologies such as OAuth and cryptography are used to sign request urls with the user secrets / tokens necessary for authorization.
# The act of appending the authorization information to the request url is known as "augmenting".
